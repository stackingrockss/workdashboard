# Vercel Deployment - Step-by-Step Fix for 404 Error

## Problem
You're getting: `404: NOT_FOUND` because Vercel can't find your Next.js app.

## Root Cause
Your Next.js app is in the `opportunity-tracker/` subdirectory, not the root of the repository.

## Solution: Configure Root Directory in Vercel

### **CRITICAL STEP - You MUST do this manually in Vercel Dashboard:**

1. **Open your Vercel project**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click on** your `workdashboard` project
3. **Click** "Settings" in the top navigation bar
4. **Click** "General" in the left sidebar
5. **Scroll down** to find "Root Directory"
6. **You will see**: `./` (this is WRONG - that's why you get 404)
7. **Click** the "Edit" button next to Root Directory
8. **Type**: `opportunity-tracker`
9. **Click** "Save"
10. **Go to** "Deployments" tab
11. **Click** the three dots (...) on the latest deployment
12. **Click** "Redeploy"

## Verification Checklist

Before redeploying, verify these settings in Vercel:

### âœ… General Settings
- [ ] Root Directory = `opportunity-tracker`
- [ ] Framework Preset = Next.js (should auto-detect)
- [ ] Build Command = `npm run build` (default is fine)
- [ ] Output Directory = `.next` (default is fine)
- [ ] Install Command = `npm install` (default is fine)

### âœ… Environment Variables
Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables and verify:

- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` is set
  ```
  postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_fLCbNhYl49qO@ep-polished-art-af8y9fux-pooler.c-2.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
  ```
- [ ] Variable is set for: Production, Preview, Development (all three)

## What Happens After Setting Root Directory

When you set Root Directory to `opportunity-tracker`, Vercel will:

1. âœ… Navigate to `opportunity-tracker/` first
2. âœ… Find `package.json` there
3. âœ… Find `next.config.ts` there
4. âœ… Run `npm install` in that directory
5. âœ… Run `prisma generate` (from vercel.json)
6. âœ… Run `next build` in that directory
7. âœ… Deploy the `.next` folder
8. âœ… Your app will work! ðŸŽ‰

## Alternative: Deploy the Subdirectory Directly

If the above doesn't work, you can:

1. Create a NEW Vercel project
2. Point it to: `github.com/stackingrockss/workdashboard`
3. Set Root Directory to: `opportunity-tracker` **during initial setup**
4. This sometimes works better than editing an existing project

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?
1. **Check build logs**: Go to Deployments â†’ Click on the deployment â†’ View Build Logs
2. **Look for errors** related to:
   - "Could not find Next.js"
   - "No package.json found"
   - File not found errors
3. **Verify** Root Directory is actually saved (refresh the Settings page to confirm)

### Build succeeds but still 404?
1. Check that the deployment URL ends with `/` (root path)
2. Try accessing `/opportunities` directly
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify the deployment shows "Ready" status

## Expected Build Output

When configured correctly, you should see:

```
Running "npm install"...
âœ“ Dependencies installed

Running "prisma generate && next build"...
âœ“ Prisma Client generated
âœ“ Creating an optimized production build
âœ“ Compiled successfully
âœ“ Linting and checking validity of types
âœ“ Collecting page data
âœ“ Generating static pages
âœ“ Build completed successfully

Deployment Ready!
```

## Need More Help?

If you're still getting 404 after following ALL steps above:

1. Send me a screenshot of your Vercel Settings â†’ General page
2. Send me the build logs from the latest deployment
3. Confirm you've actually clicked "Save" after setting Root Directory

**Remember**: The Root Directory setting CANNOT be configured via vercel.json - it MUST be set manually in the Vercel dashboard!
